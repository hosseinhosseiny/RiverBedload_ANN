# Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) Model for River Bedload Prediction

This project is associated with the paper "Development of a Machine Leanring Model for River Bedload" by Hosseiny et al. under review in ESurfD journal. 

This folder contains 
(1) a Google Colab page which describes how to use trained neural networks model for predicting river bedload. 
(2) Trained ANN Model developed by Keras (zip folder)
(3) Excel file containing train/test data along with calculated variables
